Windows
Synfig is shipped with this special script to build it on Windows (MSYS2). All you need to do is run that script.

$ ./2-build-msys-cmake.sh
Once this is completed successfully, you can run Synfig by.

$ ./cmake-build-msys/output/Release/bin/synfigstudio.exe
You can also use this script to run a debug build by using the argument: Debug

$ ./2-build-msys-cmake.sh Debug
Then, you can run Synfig by.

$ ./cmake-build-msys/output/Debug/bin/synfigstudio.exe


Packaging using CMake
As an optional step you might wish to build a package/installer for distribution.

Synfig can be packaged for different operating systems using CPack which comes with CMake.

First important thing to know is that you need a production build for that (for obvious reason it is very unlikely you want to distribute a build with debug symbols).

So, make sure to get production build first by passing the flag at cmake step:

$ cmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
Most of the configuration are already set so no extra flags need to be set for Synfig.

Below you will find instructions how to package Synfig for various operating systems.
